How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

cool, didn't even know that FC function existed in windows.
I use beyond compare for this, it is an awesome tool that I have used for 18 years.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

Obvious, able to compare versions allows you to see what may have gone wrong with an update.
This also give you confidence to make changes with risk of no return

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

Manually is the only way to go, I do not like autosave. The developer should be responsible for this.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because the files are inter-dependent.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

log allows you to see the version
diff allows you to compare two versions from the log

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

obviously - this also allows other developers to see what was changed

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

backup my projects and use it as a repository
